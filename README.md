# pomodoro
An example project for Interaction &amp; Electronics - programming aesthetic interactions


## here the list of exercises present in the repository
- **01_chainable_led_blink** - use the chainable led library to blink one led
- **02_led_blink_fastled** - blink the led using the fastled library
- **03_single_color_fade** - make the led fade
- **04_led_fade_and_change_color** - use the potentiometer to change the color of the led while it is fading; Notice that the color changes only when the loop restart.
- **05_led_fade_and_change_color_asynchronous** - use the potentiometer to change the color of the led while it is fading; Notice that the color changes indipendently from the fade sequience.
- **06_more_led_animations** - demonstrate how to create multiple types of animations using one led
- **06a_structure_the_code_in_multiple_tabs** - how to split indipendent pieces of codes into different tabs to make the code more "reusable"
- **07_make_something_move** - demonstrate how to control the servo motor in a asynchronous way
- **08_make_some_noise** - use the piezo buzzer for playing melodies
- **09_state_machine_structure** - initial state machine code structure (with the first 3 states)
- **10_pomodoro_state_machine** - the full pomodoro timer state machine
- **11_extra_advanced_led_animations** - (EXTRA) habe a look here to see how to do more advanced animation like crossfading between two colors
