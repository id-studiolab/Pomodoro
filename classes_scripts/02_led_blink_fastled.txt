# class 02 - led blink fastled

Hi guys! Welcome back!
In the previous class we saw how to make a led blink using the chainable led library.
That library, written by the manifacturer of the chainable LEd groove component (seed studio), works really well for simple things; but if you start using it extensively you will notice that it is very minimal and if you want to start creating very custom animations you will have to write a lot of custom code for example to convert a color from rgb to hsb or to just adjust the brightess.

Since the focus of this class is actually to equip you with all the best tools to program custom fedebacks I thought to just introduce you from the beginning to a more advanced library to control LEd which is called Fastled.

[slide 1]
Fastled Library is probably the best lobrary for programming colorfull led animations. At this link you can find all the documentation about the library.

One nice aspect of the library is that is doesn't only support the chainable led which are part of your kit, but many more model of digitally controllable leds and ledstrips.
This means that if you are programming some led patterns usin this library and at some point you decide that you have to change the led you can just modify few lines of code and yuur code will work exaclty in the same way.
The other advantage of using fastled is that out if the box it supposts HSV colors which is quite handy sometimes... we will see this later.
Lastly this library does everything in a very efficient way using the liest amount of Arduino resources as possible. Which is very important when you will you start driving a couple of hundreds led.

[Go to IDE]
Ok, so let's give this library a try, first of all like we did before for the chainable led library we have to install the library using the library manager.
Inside your Arduino IDE, you can go to sketch, include library, library manager and search for “fastled”. Once you find it just select it and click install.
We should be ready to go with the library. Let's open the sketch called 02_led_blink_fastled.ino and have a look at the differences between using the fastled lobrary VS the chainable led library.

Allright I think now it is clear why I like the fastled library a lot and why you should get used to it. Now that you know how to make the led blink, I'd like to give you a new challenge...
[slide 3]
can you make the LED fade in and fade out? I give you a small hint: maybe you can use the “for loop” construct to solve this challenge.
Once you think you made it go to the next video and we will look at the solution together.
