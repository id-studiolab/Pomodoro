# class 01 - setup and blink
[slide 1]
Hi guys! Welcome back to the very first part of this Arduino class! I hope you have managed to complete all the tasks I assigned to you at the end of the previous video. Anyhow, we are now going to check that everything works and I'll give you some hints on how to fix the most common issues you might encounter.

[close shot on hand and box]
So, you got the box, and hopefully you manage to squeeze everything inside without breaking it. It is now time to make some good use of it. go ahead and plug your board into the computer via the USB cable.

[switch to IDE]
First of all let’s verify that we can upload some code to the board. Open you arduino IDE, go to the menu and select tools-> board-> seeduino lotus, if you don't find it in your Arduino installation, You probably didn’t install the Seeeduino boards package correctly, go back to the Seeedstudio wiki [switch to slides][slide 2] and try to follow the instructions again.

[switch back to IDE]
Then we have to select the specific port we have the board connected to go to tools->port… and select the correct port your Seeeduino lotus is connected to. If you don’t find your Arduino in the port list, that is probably because you haven’t installed the driver correctly, or maybe you just need to reinstall your computer. [switch to slide][slide 3] Try to follow the driver installation instructions again and continue once you are able to select the right serial port.

[switch back to IDE]
If everything went as expected, let’s try to upload some simple code the the baord, I have here the blink example, let’s try to upload it... uploading… done uplaoding! urra! We don’t see anything because the on board led is inside the box, but we know the upload was successfull! great!

[switch to prototype]
Let’s try now to make this chainable RGB Led that we connected to the Arduino blink. Although it looks like a very normal LED, this component is quite advanced, [switch to slide][slide 4] the chainable LED module first of all is an RGB LED, that means that you can make it change to any color. And secondly it is possible to connect more chainable LEDS to form a chain of LEDs. You can find more documentation about this component here. For now, what is important for us to know is that in order to control the led we will need to program it using a external library. Let’s install the library first.

[switch back to IDE]
Inside your Arduino Ide, you can go to sketch, include library, library manager and search for “chainable led”. Once you find it just select it and click install. Now we should be ready to control the color of the led. To test the Led, open the second code snippet that you find in your resource folder called 01_chainable_led.ino

Let’s quickly have a look at the code structure
[live comments on the code]

The code looks alright, let’s upload it to our board and see if it actually works. [switch to prototype] mmm ok, apparently we can control this LED very good!

[switch to slide][slide 5]
Since our pomodoro kit is equipped with only one LED, we will only play with one led for the duration of this class, however feel free to try to connect multiple led in series and write some code to control them all. Remember that each LED can be programmed to show a different colour.
